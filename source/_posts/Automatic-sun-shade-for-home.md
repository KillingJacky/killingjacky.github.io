This is a kind of motor driven sun shade, DIYed for the sun shine block for the balcony of my home, controlled by IR remote. There're some kind of sun shade controller in the market, but they are expensive and take too much space of home. So what I made is a cheap and home-brew sun shade driver and controller with most of the materials handy to get.
